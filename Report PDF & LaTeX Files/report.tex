            \item[Vivan: ] Vivan fostered a positive and supportive environment, making team interactions smooth and enjoyable. He wasn’t only helping me but also he was coordinating us overall, managing our chat channels and telling us exactly how to do everything and making everything run smoothly. He was quite concise and clear on what he wanted and how he wanted it. He was also well experienced in the tools we used, so he was also helping me a lot with the problems I had. He was able to break down complex technical concepts into more digestible explanations, which has helped me not feeling overwhelmed with the work we are doing. He was very active during the development process so he was very reliable whenever I was doing my work, which reduced delays which could have been caused by the issues I had. One thing he could have done can be highlighting the issues in early development so that we could have watched out for these problems, but I would say other than that he has helped me a lot with understanding NextJS and made it very easy for me to cope with the group’s expectations.
            \item[Ayush: ] For Ayush I would say working with him was really enlightening and made me learn a lot of things. Before starting this project I had very limited knowledge of backend development and not much of frontend. I started learning Next.js and API stuff specifically to use for this project so I didn’t really have prior experience on it. I was struggling a lot, especially when setting up the APIs and trying to ensure smooth integration of backend and frontend. I would say he provided very valuable guidance, patiently explaining stuff every time I was asking him to help me with the integration etc, which was almost everyday . But this level of help made understand a lot of concepts that I was struggling to understand. He has a very patient nature where he would repeat himself many times until he made sure I understood what to do which was also good for us as it formed a positive work environment where I felt really comfortable to ask questions which helped me improve a lot. One thing I would say is that he could have sent feedback more frequently on ongoing work to catch potential issues earlier and make it easy for me to work on them during the development, as when you are a beginner in the language a lot of uncertainties arise and I get overwhelmed quite easily.
            \item[James (Ye Aung): ] Working with James throughout this project was very reassuring to say the least. We had similar level of knowledge and experience, which allowed us to relate to each other’s challenges and victories easily. While I was building the marker front end for publishing assignments, viewing submissions etc he was working on student submissions the deadline for them etc. One thing I greatly appreciated was his discipline, where he was always meeting his deadlines, which also allowed both of us to meet up almost periodically to help and learn from each other as we were both beginners for NextJS stuff. He was also very keen on learning, which allowed us to work together very efficiently, as having the same mindset allowed us to develop our code quite fast. He was quite good at summarizing the issues he had and his questions so it was really easy to relay our opinions and problems with each other. Another thing I would say about him is that he sometimes overengineers solutions for some of the simpler solutions which does sometime take time, but I would say this is not a too bad quality to have overall as sometimes it does come in handy when unexpected issues arise in the code.
